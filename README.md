# ☕ Repository of Java Projects 🚀

Welcome to my **Java Projects Repository**! This is where I document my journey through the world of **Java** and its related technologies. Just like Java's iconic coffee cup ☕, this repository symbolizes energy and focus for continuous learning.

## **📂 Project Structure**
Each folder within this repository represents a distinct project focused on **Java**. Here's how everything is organized:  

- `project_01`: "project_01" is just an example. Description of the first project. *(Replace with specific details)*  

New folders will be added as I progress on this journey! 

## **🚨 Important Note**
This repository contains projects exclusively from **paid courses on Udemy**.  
- The commits reflect the lessons I attended, but **none of the files in this repository contain any video lessons**.  
- This repository's purpose is strictly to save the notes and code I wrote while following the courses, serving as a personal reference to review concepts and theories if needed.  
- **No rights are violated**, as this repository does not include or redistribute course materials or videos. It only contains my personal work and learning outcomes.  

## **🛠️ Usage Instructions**
To explore any project:  

1. Navigate to the folder corresponding to the project of interest.  
2. Inside each folder, you will find a specific `README.md` file with detailed information about the project, including:  
   - Functionalities  
   - Technologies used  
   - Instructions for execution  

## **🌟 Additional Information**
This repository is exclusively focused on **Java and Java-related technologies**. It serves as a personal space for organizing and experimenting with what I’ve learned.
